## Run on BinderHub:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/MichaelAllen1966/2004_covid_testing_lab_simulation/master)

## Set up environment locally

To get the correct libraries and versions it is recommended that the provided conda environment is used. To create and activate a bootcomp environment:

1. Windows -> Open Anaconda prompt. Mac/linux -> Open a terminal

2. Navigate to the binder directory

3. Run the following command: conda env create -f environment.yml

This will fetch and install the libraries in a conda environment 'screening_lab'

4. To activate the bootcomp enviroment run the following command:
    conda activate screening_lab
